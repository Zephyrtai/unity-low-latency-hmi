# Real-Time HMI Prototype Using Unity and UDP

A real-time HMI prototype exploring low-latency sensor-to-UI communication using Raspberry Pi Pico W, UDP, and Unity UI Toolkit.

## Current Features
- Sensor-to-Unity real-time pipeline
- UDP communication
- Unity UI Toolkit visualization
- Real-time graph interface
- Gauge-style UI
- Data smoothing experiments
- Embedded sensor integration

## Tech Stack
- Unity
- Unity UI Toolkit
- C#
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- MicroPython
- UDP
- JSON / Binary

## System Architecture
Sensor → Pico W → UDP → Unity Receiver → Data Processing → UI

## Current Development Status
Current implementation successfully supports:

Sensor input
- UDP transmission
- Real-time Unity visualization

Next development goals:
- Filtering comparison
- Binary transmission
- Latency measurements
- UI optimization

## System Architecture
Pico W Sensor → UDP → Unity Receiver → Data Processing → UI Visualization
